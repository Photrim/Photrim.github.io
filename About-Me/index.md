# Hello, it's me.

I go by many names. You can call me Photrim, turkle, Urpy, whatever I've designated myself in the server you're in.

A little about me:
- I moderate for the [BattleTabs Discord Server](https://discord.gg/battletabs)
- I'm a busy guy, but I'll usually be available after 3 PM PST.

I like playing video games. A few to name are
- [Battletabs](https://photrim.github.io/Battletabs)

- [Roblox](https://photrim.github.io/Roblox/)
