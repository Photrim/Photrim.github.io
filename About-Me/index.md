# Hello, it's me.

You're bored. You're bored, and you were randomly clicking peoples' profiles. Well, now you're here. Enjoy the reading material.
I go by many names. You can call me Photrim, turkle, UrpyBurpy, whatever I've designated myself in the server you're in.

A little about me:

- Gamer
- I'll listen to any music that sounds catchy
- Usually chill
- Lazy
- I'm a busy guy, but I'll usually be available after 3 PM PST.
