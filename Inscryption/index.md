# About me on Inscryption

- Hardcore Inscryption fan
- Been in the Inscryption modding community for a long time
- Worked a lot of mods such as Ants+ and Pokemon mod
- Inspired and worked on Mo' Deers by Sire
- Mods worked on were played by Sifd
- Inscryption got boring so you won't see me around there that often
